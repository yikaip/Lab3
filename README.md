2. 256 makes an overflow in short
3. 21474836647 makes an overflow in long
4. 34 makes an overflow 
5. 171 makes an overflow
6. about 9 digits number makes float data type overflow and about 14 digits number makes double data type overflow; however my computer is too slow to detect the actual exact number; double data type makes it more precise than float when testing a bigger number
7. the numerical error occurs when i = 4.4; since the i is less then 4.4, this number should not be occured; it happens because i is a floating point, this is less precise
8. change i to double makes the result accurate
